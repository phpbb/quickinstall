# phpBB QuickInstall

phpBB QuickInstall is a tool used to manage multiple phpBB3 installations. You can quickly install phpBB 3.2.x, 3.1.x and 3.0.x boards with a single mouse click.

QuickInstall is not intended for use on a live server. It is aimed at users developing extensions and modifications for phpBB. QuickInstall can set up new phpBB boards to develop and test extensions or MODs in without having to worry about conflicts. If you insist on using QuickInstall on a public server, make sure to protect the folder where it is. No support is given for QuickInstall other than local use.   

## Installation & Setup
1. Copy the QuickInstall folder to your local web server. Make sure `boards/`, `cache/` and `settings/` are writable by your web server. You can move `boards` and `cache` to other locations after the initial setup if you wish.

2. [Download a copy of phpBB 3.2.x, 3.1.x or 3.0.x](https://www.phpbb.com/downloads/), extract it and copy the phpBB3 folder into `sources/`. Choose the version you do the most work with, for your own convenience.

3. Point your browser to the QuickInstall folder (e.g., https://localhost/quickinstall). You should be taken directly to the "Install QuickInstall" page. Some default values will already be filled in but you should add your database connection settings. Click "Save" once you have configured all the settings to your liking and you are good to go. If you don't set a profile name, the name "Default" will be used.

> In `sources/phpBB3_alt/` you can store additional versions of phpBB, or boards with other styles or language files. You can name them whatever you want to make it easier to recognize them when you create boards. e.g.,  `sources/phpBB3_alt/phpBB-3.0.12`, `sources/phpBB3_alt/phpBB-sv`, etc.

> If you want additional files/folders to be copied to your boards when they are created (i.e., extensions), you can put them in the `sources/extra/` folder. By using the same folder structure in `sources/extra/` as phpBB, the files/folders should be mapped to the correct locations in your boards.

> If you want to use phpBB 3.0.x with AutoMOD you will also need to download [AutoMOD](https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/official_tool/automod/). Unzip AutoMOD and copy the contents of the `root` or `upload` folder, depending on the AutoMOD version, to `sources/automod/`.

#### A Note About Passwords
QuickInstall stores all passwords in a plain text file. They are hidden in the user interface, but can be read by anyone with access to the QuickInstall folder.

## Upgrading
Download the latest QuickInstall and unzip it. Copy everything into your QuickInstall folder **except for the `boards/`, `sources/` and `settings/` folders**.

### Upgrading from QuickInstall 1.1.8 or older
Download the latest QuickInstall and unzip it into your QuickInstall folder **except for the `boards/` and `sources/` folders**. 

If upgrading from QuickInstall 1.1.8, point your browser to the Profiles page, make sure the new settings are in order and Save.

If upgrading from QuickInstall 1.1.6 or older, make sure the new `settings/` folder is writable by PHP and point your browser to your QuickInstall folder. QuickInstall will convert your old config to a profile named "Default" which you can choose to rename after it has been created.
